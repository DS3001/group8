    "This project is about building predictive algorithms that predict the likelihood a person has a stroke.\n",
    "The strategy to determine the best predictive model was to start by preparing and cleaning the variables in the data set, and then building different models. The models we build were linear models, k means clustering models, and decision trees; the model with the lowest RMSE on the testing data will be the final model.  "
